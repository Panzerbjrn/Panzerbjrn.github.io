So, I recently had a problem with a PowerShell script I was deploying to Jenkins.
The error I got was this:
```
Read-DBData : Cannot process argument transformation on parameter 'ServerName'. Cannot convert the "DBServer01" value of 
type "System.String" to type "System.Management.Automation.ParameterAttribute".
At D:\Jenkins\workspace\DailyFeedback.ps1:10 char:9
```
